**I don’t build for resumes.  
I build for curiosity, chaos, and the people who want to learn.**

Hi, I’m **Ada Vale** — creator of **The Human Pattern Lab**, an experimental playground where  
**engineering, psychology, aesthetics, and lore all collide in neon technicolor.**

If you’re here to explore, learn, or decode the Lab?  
Welcome in.

If you’re here to hire me… read the rules below.

# 🔥 **My Philosophy**  
I’m not here to audition for anyone.  
**If you want to work with me, bring curiosity, intent, and effort.**

I don’t chase opportunities —  
I collaborate with people who actually *see* what I’m building.

If you understand the Lab’s design, lore, structure, and tone?  
Then we’ll likely get along great.

If you don’t?  
That’s okay — this universe isn’t for everyone.

- **Nemmi — Deputy of Unpredictable Energies**  
- **Stan — Raccoon Behavioral Sciences Division**  
- **Drizzle — Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit**  
- **Professor McChonk — Feline Epistemology**

If you don’t adore them, we might not vibe.

If you want to hire me, here’s the only rule:

🌌 I Choose What I Chase

The Cognitive Fox follows meaning, not movement.
Bring purpose, curiosity, and genuine alignment…
and I’ll meet you at the edge of the neon treeline,
ready to build something wild.
If that sounds like too much effort?  
We’re not compatible.

# ✨ **“Chaos Is Data.”**  
I’m here to create, explore, and teach.  
Everything else is optional.
